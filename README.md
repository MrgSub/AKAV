Actual Keyboard Avoiding View

## The Problem:
Keyboard placement in React Native has been an inconvience for me and for many other developers. And simply follolowing the docs isn't quite ideal.

## The Solution:
A universal view where the skelenton of the page is defined, and `action buttons` are well positioned, regardless where the keyboard is.
